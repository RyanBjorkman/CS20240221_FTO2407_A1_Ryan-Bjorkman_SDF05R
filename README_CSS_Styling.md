#btn-1
- For btn-1 I first added a hover effect to change the background colour to green and the text to white for good contrast.This is to show the user that they are selecting this button and that is is clickable.

- I then added an active effect that once the user clicks the button it again changes colour to a yellow colour with black text. Again both colours were chosen for good contrast, as well as to show the user that the button has been clicked.

- I then set the key frames and added created the animation (pulse) using a box-shadow. I like the idea that this would encourage the user to click the button.

- Finally applying the animation (pulse) with a 1,5s animation-duration with an iteration of infinite.

#btn-2
- For btn-2 I added a hover function to change color font weight and size.
- active function to change color and transform.

#btn-3
-btn-3 I used various features from the first 2 buttons and then applied a different border animation as well as on the hover and active functions.
